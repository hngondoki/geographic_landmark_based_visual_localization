Geographical landmarks are important in image organization and navigation systems. This project explores how landmark visual search can be improved using computer vision features and classification algorithms.We conduct experiments to identify the most effective features and present a comparative analysis of four classification methods: Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM) and a Resnet Convolution Neural Network (CNN). After experimentation we found that complex features and combinations that included them outperform the simple features selected because they capture richer and more discriminative representations of the data. Deep feature extractors such as ViT and ResNet encode high-level spatial, textural, and semantic patterns that simple handcrafted descriptors cannot. As a result, models built on these complex features provide clearer class separability, higher AUC values, and more robust generalization. A combined mix of simple and complex features yielded balanced results that had a smaller test train gap hence preferred to prevent overfitting.The SVM model achieved the strongest performance, reaching an accuracy of 98.60% and a precision of 98.61%, slightly surpassing the other models. KNN achieved nearly equivalent performance while being more time-efficient, making it the most practical choice for landmark classification.
